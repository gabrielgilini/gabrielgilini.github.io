            <p>
              I started Quark Digital with my fiancée, who has extensive experience on the Advertisement Industry, to work closely - albeit remotely :) - with hand-picked clients in molding our knowledge to provide the support they need to grow their businesses out of the MVP phase without investing heavily in a senior team in-loco.
            </p>
            <p>
              As it's the case with many up-and-coming service-based startups we still don't have a website, but I promise we're working on it.
            </p>
