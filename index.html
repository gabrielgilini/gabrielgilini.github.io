    <h3>Outline</h3>
    <p>Battle-hardened software engineer with a great mind for business and a keen sense to marketing. Originally from
      Brazil, but living in Prague on a working visa. 16+ years since my first paid dev gig, diverse experience.</p>

    <h3>My story</h3>
    <p>I've been writing code since I got my first computer at 13. First some silly mIRC scripts to print a colorful
      laugh or the current track playing on WinAmp. But soon after I was looking at a C college textbook PDF trying to
      build my first programs and struggling to deal with those nasty double pointers.</p>
    <p>Going to Computer Science school was a no-brainer. Finishing was another story, though. I've ended up dropping
      out during the 6th semester to run my first startup after being invited by 4 seniors.</p>
    <p>It failed, as it usually does. So I moved to São Paulo and started working on this brand new agency focused on
      the ad industry. We grew, I got offered partner status and some shares and became the tech lead of a team with
      around 15 devs.</p>
    <p>Sometime later I go my separate way, start another business with a friend, but end up stepping away to take care
      of my health.</p>
    <p>Moved to the beautiful island of Florianópolis, started my own consultancy business and wore every hat that was
      required of me during that time until I decided I wanted to be part of a team again. By chance a friend who was
      already at STRV told me they were hiring, and that's how I ended up in Prague.</p>
    <p>Oh, and from Jan 2014 to Dec 2016 I partnered with a good friend to help run his underground electronic music
      party. I would do most of the business part while he took care of the art, it taught me a lot.</p>
